### About me:
My interest in developement started in 2020 during lockdown period. That summer I discovered a huge blank space to create anything I wanted. The only limit was my imagination and skills.Even if my imagination is quite good I was still lacking skills so my journey to the digital world of creators began.  

For me programming is not a technical skill that requires only maths and calculations. It is a huge opportunity to solve millions (if not billions) of problems using first of all creativity and non-standart thinking. Being a highschool student I thought I had to choose between maths and art cause they are two totally different things to master until I didn't find programming which connects both my favourite activities.  

Now my number one goal is to master my skills in this field and maybe bring a world something that will make it even better place to live. However I won't be sad even if I spend my days just writing a code, cause I will always be happy knowing that my peice of code is is benefiting people and helping them to love better.
